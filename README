Poked - Simple Sinatra/Github post-receive server.

In Lieu of an actual build process, this server receives Github post-receive hooks and
updates the appropriate local git repo. That's really it.

Repo mapping is done via a yaml configuration file. A 'secret' param has been added for extra
security between github --> you , but don't count on it. This is primarily for dev environments.

Have fun!
